<a name="Overview" />
## Overview ##

In this hands-on lab, you will explore the basic elements of the Windows Azure **Web Sites** service by creating a simple [PHP](http://www.php.net) application and deploying it using **FTP deployment**.

<a name="Objectives" />
### Objectives ###

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to:

- Create the Web Site from the Windows Azure portal
- Create a simple PHP application and deploy it using FTP
- Create a new Web Site with the Git publishing feature enabled using the Windows Azure Command-Line Tools for Mac and Linux and then deploy the application using GIT

<a name="Prerequisites" />
### Prerequisites ###

The following is required to complete this hands-on lab:

- [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/macosx/)
- [GIT Version Control System](http://git-scm.com/download)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/#download) 
- [Windows Azure Command-Line Tools for Mac and Linux](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/nodejs/how-to-guides/command-line-tools/)

	>**Note:** If you do not have the Windows Azure Command-Line Tools for Mac and Linux installed, open a terminal and run the following command:
	>
	>````ShellScript
	>sudo npm install azure -g
	>````
	>
	>By using -g, Windows Azure Command-Line Tools will install on your machine globally. That means, you will be able to execute azure commands from any location.
